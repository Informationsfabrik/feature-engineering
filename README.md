## Automating feature engineering

### About

Testing and benchmarking methods for automated feature engineering.
The following python libraries are to be tested:

* TPOT
* featuretools
* TSFRESH

### Dataset

For this analysis the dataset from the Rossmann Kaggle Challange was chosen (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data).
In order to speed up the necessary computation for model to be created, only the first store out of this dataset is considered (Id = 1).

**Features:**
- Id - an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set
- Store - a unique Id for each store
- Sales - the turnover for any given day (this is what you are predicting)
- Customers - the number of customers on a given day
- Open - an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open
- StateHoliday - indicates a state holiday. Normally all stores, with few exceptions, are closed on state holidays. Note that all schools are closed on public holidays and weekends. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None
- SchoolHoliday - indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools
- StoreType - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d
- Assortment - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended
- CompetitionDistance - distance in meters to the nearest competitor store
- CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year] - gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened
- Promo - indicates whether a store is running a promo on that day
- Promo2 - Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating
- Promo2Since[Year/Week] - describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2
- PromoInterval - describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. "Feb,May,Aug,Nov" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store
